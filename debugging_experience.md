It's a pain to debug the pomodoro script. The following improvements will help:

- basic tests for functions
- improving test coverage
- support debug mode (TODO: what does this look like?)
- support code introspection (TODO: what does this look like?)

Testing Suite:

# Testing
- Write test for one function
- Document process
- Break down more functions into tests
