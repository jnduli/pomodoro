Debugging the pomodoro bash script is a pain and takes a while to figure out. I
need to improve a lot on this front by:

- adding test cases
- having a debug mode that outputs the content
- research how to debug bash scripts
- better design of the whole script
- code introspection

# Testing
- Figure out one code section to write a test for
- Investigate bash script testing strategy
- Implement test for this one function
- Create a ci action that runs bash tests
- Determine the coverage
- Determine other code sections worth testing
